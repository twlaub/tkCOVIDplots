# tkCOVIDplots
There are now two scripts. The original is just for the United States and
is now named tkCOVIDplots-USA.py. The new script is for the entire world
and is named tkCOVIDplots-world.py. The interface is as described below for
both scripts.

Python script to go get United States COVID-19 data and create plots.

This script goes and gets the United States COVID-19 data from the
New York times database. There is a GUI where you can select the 
types of plots you want and for which states. Selection is by 
check boxes. Everytime you click the doPlots button the data is 
fetched anew and all plots are sent to the screen at the same time.
You must close each plot individually.

Since there are already so many of these COVID-19 plotters available
I make no copyright claim. You are free to use, modify, pass around,
incorporate without licensing issues.
